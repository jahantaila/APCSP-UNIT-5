**LESSON 2: LISTS INVESTIGATE**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm up - How does a list manage complexity in a program?
- Programs that use lists are easier to read and manage - separate variables are not needed for each individual element

Warm Up - What are some similarities and differences between lists and variables?
- Both are used to store information
- Lists store multiple items, but variables only store one
- When written in Javascript, both start with the keyword var
- Lists are written with square brackets around them
- Lists can store many different types of data

Wrap Up - What aspects of using lists do you feel you already understand? What questions do you want to dig into more tomorrow during the practice lesson
