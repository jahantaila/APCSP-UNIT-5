**LESSON 2: LISTS INVESTIGATE**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm up - How does a list manage complexity in a program?
- Programs that use lists are easier to read and manage - separate variables are not needed for each individual element

Warm Up - What are some similarities and differences between lists and variables?
- You don't need to know how a list is created in order to use it - all you need is the name. There is a separation between the abstract properties of the data type (list) and the concrete details of its representation.
