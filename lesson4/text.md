**LESSON 4: LISTS MAKE**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Warm Up - Imagine you want to build an app for reminders. What information do you think would be stored in a list?
- The reminders could be stored in a list

Prompt - How many lists do you think are needed to make this app work?
- Only one list is needed. It stores all of the reminders.

Prompt - What programming patterns with lists do you think you'll need to use?
- This app uses the List Scrolling pattern to scroll through the values, and a boundary counter pattern to change the values of each reminder index. Also wouldent the app use a dependency interjection pattern because we pass the differnet list objects through an event handler instead of creating it immidetly?
